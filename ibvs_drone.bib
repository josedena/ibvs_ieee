abstract = {This paper describes a vision-based tracking system using an autonomous Quadrotor Unmanned Micro-Aerial Vehicle (MAV). The vision-based control system relies on color target detection and tracking algorithm using integral image, Kalman filters for relative pose estimation, and a nonlinear controller for the MAV stabilization and guid-ance. The vision algorithm relies on information from a single onboard camera. An arbitrary target can be selected in real-time from the ground control station, thereby outperforming template and learning-based approaches. Experimental results obtained from outdoor flight tests, showed that the vision-control system enabled the MAV to track and hover above the target as long as the battery is available. The target does not need to be pre-learned, or a template for detection. The results from image processing are sent to navigate a non-linear controller designed for the MAV by the researchers in our group.},

abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive image-based visual servoing (IBVS) integrated with adaptive sliding mode control for a vision-based operation of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). For a seamless integration with underactuated quadrotor dynamics, roll and pitch channels are decoupled from the other channels using virtual features. This allows a simple and accurate algorithm for estimating depth information and successful application of the proposed guidance and control algorithm. By employing an adaptive gain in the IBVS control method, the chance of image feature loss is reduced, and performance and stability of the vision-guided UAV control system are improved. The overall setup allows image features to be placed at the desired position in the image plane of a camera mounted on the quadrotor UAV. Stability of the IBVS system with the controller is proved using Lyapunov stability analysis. Performance of the overall approach is validated by numerical simulation, vision integrated hardware-inthe- loop simulation, and experiments. The results confirm that the target image is successfully placed at the desired position of the image plane and the quadrotor state variables are properly regulated, showing robustness in the presence of sensor noise, parametric uncertainty, and vibration from motors.

abstract = {This paper presents a fully autonomous system for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that employs the visual measurements to perform automatic landing task on a specific landing platform. Basically, there are two main control tasks discussed in this paper. The first task refers to the auto-land mission that tracks the platform horizontally and performs the vertical landing. It was accomplished by using the red blob tracking technique. The second task involves the robust motion tracking that activates the recovery action once the target is lost so that the vehicle is still able to hover steadily. It was realized by implementing the features accelerated from segment test (FAST) technique with the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm to detect the local feature in the image and compute the optical flow. From the visual results obtained, the position and velocity of the vehicle were estimated using a nested Kalman-based sensor fusion. The state estimation was validated in a series of experiments using a CNC milling machine. Lastly, the control architecture for automatic landing system was formed with the classical PID controller and the flight test proved the success of the proposed system.},

abstract = {Towards tackling the evident practical challenges of fault detection and diagnosis for PV modules, especially in large-scale installations, this paper proposes two different techniques for advanced inspection mapping of PV plants; aerial triangulation and terrestrial georeferencing. The former uses data of aerial thermal/visual imagery of operating PV modules, obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), to generate static “inspection maps”, in the form of true orthophoto mosaics. On the other hand, georeferencing is used to associate terrestrial thermal/visual imagery, obtained at distinct positions in a PV plant, with geographic data. By such way, inspection is based on a dynamic virtual map of the installation. Both mapping techniques were tested in two grid-connected PV systems, of a total installed power of 70.2 KWp. Several defective modules were easily and accurately detected, typically as abnormal temperature profiles, in the infrared (IR) spectrum. In addition, specific thermal image patterns of operating modules, were validated and quantified by additional diagnostic measurements, and were assigned to possible fault types. On the basis of the experience feedback, the potential of the proposed techniques and their limitations, for further application to PV plants of larger scale, are also discussed.},

Nowadays, landmines in Colombia are harmful and even letal artifacts mostly abandoned in rural areas. A percentage of the overall number of landmines are hand-crafted and partially exposed on the terrain's surface so that they can be triggered. Based on that fact, we propose an artificial vision approach as a complementary tool for landmine detection. To this purpose, we have developed an open-source software package based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) platform that can be easily: (i) integrated with a low-cost quadrotor such as the AR.drone parrot 2.0 and (ii) applied for real-time visual detection of landmine-like objects (tuna cans).

The goal is to enable the UAV to adjust its position to hover above the observed target using only visual measurements as feedback. The closed loop control law formulation is based on a cascade system consisting of multiple inner loop PID controllers and an outer loop IBVS controller. The IBVS method provides the reference signals for the quadrotor translational velocity components and the rate of change of the heading angle while the PID controllers force the quadrotor to track the desired reference values. The proposed control method combining both IBVS and PID algorithm is tested through numerical simulations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the design of a navigation control algorithm for the autonomous landing of a quadrotor on a moving mobile platform. The quadrotor's velocity is unknown, and we assume that it is equipped with an on-board downward-looking single camera for determining its position relative to the target. The proposed autonomous landing operation proceeds in three phases: the search phase, the homing phase, and the landing phase. To prepare for these phases, a safety sphere with a desired radius having the target position as its center is constructed along with a virtual target point that can move on its surface. During the docking procedure, the quadrotor is first commanded to reach the virtual target point; as it approaches this target point, a second stage is initiated to provide the quadrotor with more precise guidance to land safely on the mobile platform. The core design of the landing algorithm is proposed based on a concise adaptive tracking control scheme using backstepping and dynamic surface control. Simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed guidance landing control approach.},

abstract = {Use of landmines as a weapon of unconventional warfare rapidly increased in armed conflicts of the last century and some estimates suggest that at least 100 million remain in place across post-conflict nations. Among munitions and explosives of concern (MECs), aerially deployed plastic anti-personnel mines are particularly challenging in terms of their detection and subsequent disposal. Detection and identification of MECs largely relies on the geophysical principles of magnetometry and electromagnetic-induction (EMI), which makes non-magnetic plastic MECs particularly difficult to detect and extremely dangerous to clear. In a recent study we demonstrated the potential of time-lapse thermal-imaging technology to detect unique thermal signatures associated with plastic MECs. Here, we present the results of a series of field trials demonstrating the viability of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with infrared cameras to detect and identify the most notorious plastic landmines-the Soviet-era PFM-1 aerially deployed antipersonnel mine. We present results of an experiment simulating analysis of a full-scale ballistic PFM-1 minefield and demonstrate our ability to accurately detect and identify all elements associated with this type of deployment. We report significantly reduced time and equipment costs associated with the use of a UAV-mounted infrared system and anticipate its utility to both the scientific and non-governmental organization (NGO) community.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles are becoming an important part of the modern life. Despite some recent advances in GPS-aided navigation of quadrotors, the concern of crash and collision still overshadows their reliability and safety, especially in GPS-denied environments. Therefore, the necessity for developing fully automatic methods for safe, accurate, and independent landing of drones increases over time. This paper investigates the autolanding process by focusing on an accurate and continuous position estimation of the drone using a monocular vision system and the fusion with the inertial measurement unit and ultrasonic sensors' data. An ARUCO marker is used as the landing pad, and the information is processed in the ground station through a real-time Wi-Fi link. In order to overcome the closed loop instability caused by the communication and localization delays, we propose a method called "movement slicing method". This method divides the moves around the marker into moving and waiting slices and makes the landing process not only more accurate but also faster. Experimental results show a successful landing of the UAV on a predefined location, while it is accurately aligned with the marker using the proposed method.},

This paper presents an empirical analysis of this lift force acting on quadrotors with different propeller sizes and hovering over various surface types. A new mathematical model for ground effect which comprises surface type dependency is proposed and verified experimentally. Modelling error is reduced by 14{\%} in average compared to the most sophisticated ground effect model available in the literature. A ground effect compensator for quadrotor altitude control is introduced to verify the modelling accuracy of the proposed approach. In terms of altitude tracking errors, a 20-80{\%} improvement is achieved with the proposed model. Furthermore, it is observed that in average the compensator based on the proposed model reduces the control effort by half compared to that attained with previous models.},
